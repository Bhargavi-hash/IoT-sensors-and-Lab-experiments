# IoT-sensors-and-Lab-experiments
Arduino code for the tasks given in IoT lab with few of their pictures and vedios
## Brief overview on what has been covered in the sessions
Please go through the LAB manuals before looking at the code.
* **LAB-1:**
  - Part 1: In this lab session, we will introduce how to control an external device like LED and BUZZER using the pins on ESP32.
  - Part 2: In this lab session,we will introduce how to print the output of the sensor data on to serial monitor using the micro USB cable. 
  - Part 3: In this lab session, we will introduce how to read the inputs using Serial.read from the serial monitor and controlling the buzzerâ€™s frequency using the tone function.
* **LAB-2:**
  - Part 1: DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with arduino IDE
  - Part 2: Controlling the ServoMotor by setting threshold
* **LAB-3:**
  - Part 1: Read the values of temperature and pressure using BMP sensor
  - Part 2: Extend the code for using the Custom pins in the ESP32 as SDL and SCL for I2C communication
* **LAB-4:**
  - Part 1: Read the values from the water level sensor and output to the Serial monitor
  - Part 2: Read the value from a capacitive touch pin and print it to the Serial monitor. Activate the buzzer when touch is detected.
  - Part 3: Combine the previous two experiments to create a system that records the current water level when pin is touched and sounds the buzzer if the water level deviates beyond a threshold.
* **LAB-5:**
  - Part 1: Use PIR sensor to detect and update the info at a webpage using server approach
  - Part 2: Buzz the buzzer and light up an LED through a webpage using client approach
  - Part 0: Turn your localIP or localhost into a global link using 3rd party applications
* **LAB-6:**
  - Part 1: Use the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor to get the distance value of the object kept infront and display the reading on the serial monitor
  - Part 2: Use the bluetooth functionality of the ESP32 dev module to communicate with the Serial bluetooth terminal on the phone.
* **LAB-7:**
  - Part 1: Build resource tree on oneM2M server.
  - Part 2: Create CIN in your resource tree from esp32.
  - Part 3: Fetch data and create graph.
* **LAB-8:**
  - Part 1: ESP32 Publish sensor data to Thingspeak using ESP32.
  - Part 2: Control an LED using Thingspeak.
